# hello-world

Hi there!

I'm going to hashtag learn to code via the Harvard CS50 online site. Then will eventually pursue an MS in CS at some 
university, somewhere. Currently working in the oil industry, and while that work is lucrative, I have a feeling that it's not
a long-term gig. So, onward to new horizons!
